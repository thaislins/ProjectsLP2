## About

Binary Search Tree in Java with Graphical User Interface.

## Notes
	When running the program sometimes the GUI might not fully load, to solve this just close the running program and execute it again. 
	The search and remove options only work if the user inputs an ID number, if only a name is inserted then the Node will not be found or removed from the tree.
